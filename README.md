# Flappy Bird with NEAT Algorithm

## Overview

This repository features a Flappy Bird game combined with a NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The NEAT algorithm is employed to train AI agents to play and eventually master the game. Through evolutionary learning, the agents adapt and improve with each attempt, showcasing the power of neuroevolution in game environments.

## Features

- **Flappy Bird Game**: A classic Flappy Bird clone implemented for training purposes.
- **NEAT Algorithm**: Utilizes the NEAT algorithm to evolve AI agents that learn to play Flappy Bird.
- **Evolutionary Learning**: Agents learn from their successes and failures, evolving over generations to improve performance.
- **Visualization**: Observe how AI agents progress and learn the game in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asoron/Machien-Learning-FlappyBird.git
